    <p>Foxes are small-to-medium-sized, omnivorous mammals belonging to several genera of the family Canidae. Foxes have a flattened skull, upright triangular ears, a pointed, slightly upturned snout, and a long bushy tail (or brush). </p>

    <p>Twelve species belong to the monophyletic group of Vulpes genus of "true foxes". Foxes live on every continent except Antarctica. By far the most common and widespread species of fox is the red fox with about 47 recognized subspecies. The global distribution of foxes, together with their widespread reputation for cunning, has contributed to their prominence in popular culture and folklore in many societies around the world.</p>

    <p>Male foxes are known as dogs, tods or reynards, females as vixens, and young as cubs, pups, or kits. A group of foxes is referred to as a skulk, leash, or earth.?!</p>

    <p>Foxes are generally smaller than other members of the family Canidae such as wolves, jackals, and domestic dogs. Foxes are digitigrade, and thus walk on their toes.</p>

    <p>In the wild, the typical lifespan of a fox is 1-3 years, up to 10 years. Unlike many canids, foxes are not always pack animals. Typically, they live in small family groups, but some (Arctic foxes) are known to be solitary.</p>

    <p>Foxes are omnivores. The diet of foxes is largely made up of invertebrates such as insects, and small vertebrates such as reptiles and birds, and can include eggs and plants. Many species are generalist predators, but some (such as the crab-eating fox) have more specialized diets. Most species of fox consume around 1 kg of food every day. Foxes cache excess food, burying it for later consumption. </p>

    <p>The island fox, though considered a near-threatened species throughout the world, is becoming increasingly endangered in its endemic environment of the California Channel Islands. Island populations, therefore, are highly susceptible to external threats ranging from introduced predatory species and humans to extreme weather.</p>

    <p>Darwin's fox is considered critically endangered because of their small known population of 250 mature individuals as well as their restricted distribution. A major problem the species faces is their dwindling, limited habitat due to the cutting and burning of the unprotected forests. Because of deforestation, the Darwin's fox habitat is shrinking, allowing for their competitor's (chilla fox) preferred habitat of open space, to increase. Another problem they face is their inability to fight off diseases transmitted by the increasing number of pet dogs.</p>

    <p>There are many records of domesticated red foxes, but rarely of sustained domestication. A notable case is the Russian silver fox; the current group of domesticated silver foxes are the result of nearly fifty years of experiments in the Soviet Union and Russia to domesticate the silver morph of the red fox. This selective breeding resulted in physical and behavioral traits appearing that are frequently seen in domestic cats, dogs, and other animals, such as pigmentation changes, floppy ears, and curly tails. </p>

    <p>The fox appears in many cultures, usually in folklore. However, there are slight variations in their depictions in folklore. In Western folklore and also in Persian folklore, foxes are depicted as a symbol of cunning and trickery â€“ a reputation derived especially from their reputed ability to evade hunters. These traits are used on a wide variety of characters, either making them a nuisance to the story, a misunderstood hero, or a devious villain.</p> 

   <p>In Asian folklore, foxes are depicted as a familiar spirit possessed of magic powers. Similar to Western folklore, foxes are depicted as mischievous, usually tricking other people, with the ability to disguise as an attractive female human. However, there are other depictions of foxes as a mystical, sacred creature, that can either bring wonder or ruin. Nine-tailed foxes appear in Chinese folklore, literature, and mythology, and can be a good or bad omen.</p>
