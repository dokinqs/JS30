# JS30 

~ [Showcase of All 30 Demo Sites](https://dokinqs.github.io/JS30/) ~

My awesome version of the Javascript 30 Day Challenge. 
I was sort of obsessed with making the CSS nice and adding interesting content and features.

Thanks to wesbos and his excellent video tutorials, and also amelieyeh, afuh, and miayam, whose repositories and notes helped a lot.
